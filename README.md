## :star: Inspiration
As I approach my graduation on May, 2025, I realized I needed to brush up on my skills for upcoming tech interviews. 
Many computer science students face the same struggle when preparing for exams or interviewsâ€”staying motivated, setting clear goals, and tracking progress over time. This led to the creation of PrepTracker, 
a tool designed to help students manage and track their study goals in a personalized, AI-driven way.

## :hammer_and_pick: What it does
PrepTracker allows students to set daily, weekly, and one-time study goals over a span of the start and end date of the goals, track progress via a heatmap dashboard, and receive AI-generated motivational reminders via email. 
The tool helps students stay on top of their goals, providing a visual representation of their achievements and keeping them engaged throughout their study process.

## :european_castle: Architecture
This project is a monorepo where the frontend and backend code reside in the same repository. The Nextjs frontend communicates with the `Nodejs` backend. `Firebase Storage` has been used as 
the database and authentications is implemented using `Firebase Authentication`. The backend is deployed using Firebase functions, which is basically a serverless framework that lets us automatically 
run backend code in response to events triggered by HTTPS requests. For personalized reminders, I integrated Meta's `Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct` through `OpenRouter` to generate AI-driven motivational messages. 
A cron-job for sending customized emails reminiding students of their goals for the day is also implemented using `Firebase Schedule Functions`, `Twilio` and `SendGrid`. 
The frontend is deployed using `Vercel hosting`.
